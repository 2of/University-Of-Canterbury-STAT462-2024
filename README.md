Statistical analysis work from this paper

This repo is primarily just R code for the various topics covered. Do we enjoy working in R? Not really. Are environment variables absolutely insane to work with? *yes* *yes they are*



There's examples of discriminant analysis, KNN analysis and a bunch of regression metrics including feature selection and all the stats that go along with that.
